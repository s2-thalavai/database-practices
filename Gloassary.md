### what is latency?

Latency is the time delay between an action and its corresponding response.

In computing and networking, it's often used to describe the delay between when a request 
is made (say, clicking a link or calling an API) and when the first byte of the response is received. 
Think of it as the "lag" in a system—how long it takes to react to a stimulus.

Here are a few examples to make it clearer:

        Network latency: The time it takes for data to travel from your device to a server and back.
        A round-trip ping to a server is a good measure of this.

        Database latency: How long it takes for a query to be processed and return results.

        Application latency: The delay a user experiences from an action (e.g., tapping a button) to the system showing the output.

High latency can feel like sluggish performance, while low latency means snappy, 
real-time responsiveness—something especially critical in cloud systems, 
gaming, trading platforms, or video calls.


## what is concurrency control

Concurrency control is the set of techniques used to manage simultaneous operations on a database 
without letting them interfere with each other. It ensures that when multiple users or 
processes access or modify data at the same time, the integrity and consistency of the database are preserved.

Imagine two people trying to book the last seat on a flight at the same time—without concurrency control, 
both might succeed, leading to chaos. With proper control, only one booking goes through, and the other is gracefully handled.

    Why It Matters

            Prevents conflicts like lost updates, dirty reads, or inconsistent data

            Maintains isolation between transactions (a key part of ACID properties)

            Supports multi-user environments where parallel access is common

    Common Techniques

        Lock-based protocols: Transactions acquire locks on data before accessing it. 
        Think of it like reserving a table before dining.

        Timestamp ordering: Each transaction gets a timestamp, and operations are ordered accordingly to avoid conflicts.

        Optimistic concurrency control: Transactions proceed without locking, 
        but validate at commit time to ensure no conflicts occurred.

In systems like MongoDB (with WiredTiger), concurrency control happens at the document level, allowing high throughput and fine-grained parallelism. In traditional SQL databases, it often involves row-level or table-level locks.


## What are the advantages of optimistic concurrency control?

Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) is like trusting everyone to play fair—until the very end, 
when you double-check that no one stepped on anyone else’s toes. It’s especially useful in systems where conflicts are rare. Here’s why it shines:

    1. Minimal Locking Overhead

        OCC avoids locking data during transactions. This means no waiting around for locks to be released, which reduces contention and improves system responsiveness.

    2. Higher Throughput
    
        Because transactions don’t block each other with locks, more of them can be processed in parallel. 
        This is great for high-concurrency environments with low conflict rates.

    3. Deadlock-Free
    
        No locks = no deadlocks. OCC eliminates the classic “you wait for me, 
        I wait for you” scenario that can freeze systems.

    4. Better Performance in Low-Conflict Scenarios
    
        In systems where users rarely update the same data simultaneously—like analytics dashboards 
        or read-heavy workloads—OCC allows transactions to breeze through without unnecessary checks.

    5. Simplified Debugging and Auditing
    
        Since OCC often involves maintaining local copies of data and validating changes at commit time, 
        it’s easier to trace what each transaction tried to do and why it succeeded or failed.

That said, OCC isn’t ideal for high-conflict environments—frequent rollbacks can hurt performance. 
But in the right context, it’s a sleek, efficient way to keep things moving.

Want to explore how OCC compares to pessimistic locking in microservices or distributed databases? That could be a fun deep dive.

## What are the disadvantages of optimistic concurrency control?

Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) is great when conflicts are rare—but when they’re not, 
it can become a bit of a headache. 

Here are the key drawbacks:

1. High Cost of Rollbacks

    If a conflict is detected during the validation phase, the entire transaction must be rolled back and retried.
    This can be expensive, especially for long-running or complex transactions.

3. Poor Performance in High-Conflict Environments

    OCC assumes conflicts are rare. But in systems with frequent concurrent updates—like collaborative editing or
   high-traffic e-commerce—conflicts become common, leading to repeated rollbacks and wasted work.

5. Starvation of Large Transactions

    When small, fast transactions frequently conflict with larger ones, the larger ones may keep getting rolled back.
   This can lead to starvation, where long transactions never complete successfully.

7. Validation Overhead

    The validation phase adds computational overhead, especially when many transactions are in-flight.
   This can impact performance in systems with high concurrency.

9. Limited Support for Incremental Sharing

    OCC doesn’t allow intermediate results of one transaction to be shared with others during execution.
   This limits concurrency in workflows that could otherwise benefit from partial progress sharing.

In short, OCC is like trusting everyone to work independently and only checking for issues at the end. It’s efficient when that trust holds—but when it doesn’t, the cost of cleaning up can outweigh the benefits.


## Optimistic Locking vs Pessimistic Locking

Here’s a clear breakdown of Optimistic Locking vs Pessimistic Locking, especially relevant
when you're designing systems that deal with concurrent data access:

### Optimistic Locking

This approach assumes that conflicts are rare. 
It allows multiple transactions to proceed without locking resources, but checks for conflicts before committing.

How it works:

    A transaction reads data and notes a version (timestamp, version number, etc.).

    Before writing, it checks if the version has changed.

    If it has, the transaction is rolled back and retried.

Pros:

        No locks = higher concurrency and throughput.

        No deadlocks.

        Ideal for read-heavy or low-conflict environments (e.g., analytics dashboards, product catalogs).

Cons:

        Rollback overhead if conflicts occur.

        Not suitable for high-contention scenarios.

        Can lead to starvation of long-running transactions.

### Pessimistic Locking

This approach assumes that conflicts are likely. It locks the data as soon as a transaction accesses 
it, preventing others from modifying it until the lock is released.

How it works:

    A transaction locks the data (read or write).

    Other transactions must wait or are blocked until the lock is released.

Pros:

    Prevents conflicts before they happen.

    Ensures strong consistency.

    Better for write-heavy or high-contention systems (e.g., banking, inventory management).

Cons:

    Lower concurrency due to blocking.

    Risk of deadlocks.

    Requires careful lock management and can increase latency.


## Eventual vs storng consistenct databases examples

Here’s a quick tour of real-world examples that highlight the difference between eventual and strong consistency in databases:

## Eventual Consistency – Examples

    These systems prioritize availability and partition tolerance, accepting temporary inconsistencies:

    Amazon DynamoDB: By default, it offers eventual consistency for faster reads across distributed regions. 
    Great for shopping carts, product catalogs, or social feeds.

    Apache Cassandra: Designed for high availability and partition tolerance, often used in messaging apps or IoT platforms.

    Couchbase (in certain modes): Offers eventual consistency for mobile and edge deployments.

    Social Media Platforms: When you like a post on Instagram or Twitter, others might not see it immediately—that’s eventual consistency in action.

## Strong Consistency – Examples

    These systems ensure that every read reflects the latest write, no matter what:

    PostgreSQL / MySQL / Oracle: 
    
        Traditional relational databases with ACID guarantees—used in banking, inventory, and ERP systems.

    Google Spanner: 
    
        A globally distributed SQL database that provides strong consistency using TrueTime API.

    MongoDB (with majority write concern and read concern “majority”): 
    
        Can be configured for strong consistency in critical operations.

    Airline Reservation Systems: 
    
        When you book a seat, it must be locked and reflected instantly across all systems to avoid double booking.
